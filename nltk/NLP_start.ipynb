      "      day, and he never failed to look at them in the most simple and practical\n",
      "      light. He had never heard of such things before. Could he do without\n",
      "      factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made Vermont gray, he said, and\n",
      "      that was good. Could he dispense with tea and coffee? Did this country\n",
      "      afford any beverage beside water? He had soaked hemlock leaves in water\n",
      "      and drank it, and thought that was better than water in warm weather. When\n",

      "      accounts of the origin of this institution, and the very derivation of the\n",

      "      the true reason for their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to\n",
      "      him any other. At another time, hearing Plato's definition of a man—a\n",

      "      appeared to conceive of was a simple expediency, such as you might expect\n",
      "      an animal to appreciate; and this, practically, is true of most men. If I\n",

      "      illiterate, who take their own view always, or do not pretend to see at\n",
